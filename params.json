A Web Application created with this project will contain html templating engines,\r\najax services, local persistence that leverages HTML5 localStorage, form reading, writing and validation, and an\r\nincredible suite of excellent JavaScript tools including specifcation patterns and DTO (Data Transfer Objects),\r\nbrought to you by [ku4js-kernel](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-kernel) and\r\n[ku4js-data](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-data). All of these technologies are rooted in SOLID OO\r\nprinciples and thoughtful observation of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS SoC and IoC.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.kodmunki.com/media/logo-small.png\" alt=\"kodmunki\" />\r\n\r\n---\r\n#Documentation\r\n\r\nThe ku4js-webApp library, at its core, consists of Models, Views, Controllers, Templates, and Configs. The following documentation discusses each of these parts, their roll in a ku4js-webApp application and their various components.\r\n\r\nThis documentation also disucsses the incredibly powerful ku4webApp Test Bundle. This test bundle enables developers to follow a TDD workflow and write deep, atomic unit tests for every aspect of their ku4js-webApp web application.\r\n\r\nThe API tables in each section of the documentation contain three columns.\r\n\r\n| API | Return | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n|This column contains the actual JavaScript API of the property or method in question. Proper syntax is depicted. Argument types are displyed in italics. Class/static methods are denoted with the class name, whereas instance level methods will begin with a dot. Example class/static method: **$.math.round(value:_Number_, nearest:_Number_)**. Example of an instance method: **.toString()**. Those methods prefixed by a $ are protected and should only be accessed from within a given instance. | The return values type, if any. A value of \"this\" in this column indicates the return of a reference to self | This column contains descriptions and any **Gotchas!** |\r\n\r\nAn example project can be found in the [_example/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_example) directory at the project root.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#Setup\r\nku4js-webApp ships with a [_TEMPLATE/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_TEMPLATE) so, although there is a dependent directory structure for a ku4js-webApp project, getting started is very simple!\r\n\r\nTo get your project going simply follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Copy the contents of _TEMPLATE into your project.\r\n2. Update the project name (PROJNAME variable) in the sh and cmd build script files. To do this, simply open these files in a text editor and update the PROJNAME variable found on line 29 of each of these files.\r\n3. Build the application using the appropriate sh or cmd build script.\r\n\r\nYou now should have a \"compiled\" JavaScript artifacts in your /bin directory. One, that is compressed, and one that is not compressed.\r\n\r\nTo add your app to a web project:\r\n\r\n1. Add a reference in the desired HTML page to **_one_** of the artifacts in the /bin directory. _(You will likely add refrence to the minified version)_\r\n2. Add a reference in the desired HTML page to your ku4js-webApp project's app.js file.\r\n\r\nThere! You are now set up for development!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Models\r\nThe first component of an MVC application is M (Model). ku4js-webApp projects keep all model files in the models/ directory. Each model represents a core component of the application. Each model has read/write access to the applications state, the client-side NoSQL database, ajax services, sockets, and the application mediator used to notify views of state changes. \r\n\r\nku4js-webApp models are intended to be the sole driver of application state and the medium through which your application accesses the server and the client-side NoSQL database. Developer implemented ku4js-webApp models can be accessed by ku4js-webApp controllers and ku4js-webApp views, to call methods and read state respectively.\r\n\r\n **For further details you can view the [example/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_example) application or watch the tutorial videos COMING SOON.**\r\n\r\nAPI and template documentation follow:\r\n\r\n###ku4js-webApp model API:\r\n\r\n| API | Return | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| .$collection(name:_String_) | collection | Retrieves the collection named \"name\". |\r\n| .$service(name:_String_) | service | Retrieves the service named \"name\". |\r\n| .$socket(name:_String_) | service | Retrieves the socket named \"name\". _(included)_|\r\n| .$validator(name:_String_) | validator | Retrieves the validator named \"name\". |\r\n| .$state() | state | Retrieves the local state. |\r\n| .$appState() | state | Retrieves the appliation state. |\r\n| .$notify(name:_String_, data:_Object_, ...) | void | Sends a notification containg the data argument(s) to the name or names in the name string argument _(multiple names can be passed by seperating them with a comma)_ |\r\n\r\n###ku4js-webApp model class template:\r\nA ku4js-webApp models can be defined using a template like the one below. You never have to instantiate a ku4js-webApp model, only define it. ku4js-webApp models are managed by the ku4js-webApp runtime. You have access your defined model in your ku4js-webApp controllers and ku4js-webApp views via the .$model(\"name\") API. _(See the [Controllers](#controllers) and [Views](#views) documentation for more details_\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4webApp.model(\"NAME\", {\r\n    //METHODS GO HERE\r\n    METHOD: function() { },\r\n    CALLBACK: function() { }\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    //MEDIATOR SUBSCRIPTIONS GO HERE\r\n    \"SUBSCRIPTION\": CALLBACK\r\n});\r\n```\r\n**For further details you can view the [example/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_example) application or watch the tutorial videos COMING SOON.**\r\n\r\n##Views\r\n\r\nku4js-webApp views are responsible for interpreting model state and presenting appropriate data to the user. Though you are certain to see other libraries i.e. jQuery being used in the [example/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_example) application due to its excellence in working with the DOM, it must be stressed that ku4js-webApp views just like all of the ku4js-* JavaScript Framework suite, are independed of any other libraries or Frameworks outside of the ku4js-* Framework suite. This frees you to use as many or as few other frameworks as you desire.\r\n\r\nku4js-webApp views will commonly listen for notifications from ku4js-webApp models and then act in accordinance with the data they receive through these notifications.\r\n\r\n **For further details you can view the [example/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_example) application or watch the tutorial videos COMING SOON.**\r\n\r\nAPI and template documentation follow:\r\n\r\n###ku4js-webApp view API:\r\n\r\n| API | Return | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| .$template(name:_String_) | template | Retrieves the template named \"name\". |\r\n| .$form(name:_String_) | form | Retrieves the form named \"name\". |\r\n| .$navigator() | navigator | Retrieves the global navigator. |\r\n\r\n###ku4js-webApp view class template:\r\nA ku4js-webApp views can be defined using a template like the one below. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4webApp.view(\"NAME\", {\r\n    //METHODS GO HERE\r\n    METHOD: function() { },\r\n    CALLBACK: function() { }\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    //MEDIATOR SUBSCRIPTIONS GO HERE\r\n    \"SUBSCRIPTION\": CALLBACK\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour views should be instantiated in the app.js file on app load using the following syntax, where \"app\" is a refrence to the ku4js-webApp app instance:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4webApp.view.NAME(app);\r\n```\r\n\r\n **For further details you can view the [example/](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-webApp/tree/master/_example) application or watch the tutorial videos COMING SOON.**\r\n\r\n##Controllers\r\n\r\n\r\n| API | Return | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| .$model(name:_String_) | model | Retrieves the model named \"name\". |\r\n| .$form(name:_String_) | form | Retrieves the form named \"name\". |\r\n| .$navigator() | navigator | Retrieves the global navigator. |\r\n\r\n* Runtime instantiation requires a valid modelFactory and formFactory.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4webApp.controller(\"NAME\", {\r\n    //METHODS GO HERE\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Applications/ files\r\n\r\nThese files are where you will initialize your controllers and views and expose your controller to the HTML page.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar controller;\r\n$(function(){\r\n    var appName = \"[ENTER YOUR APP NAME HERE]\",\r\n        app = $.ku4webApp.app();\r\n    controller = $.ku4webApp.controllers[appName](app)\r\n    $.ku4webApp.views[appName](app);\r\n\r\n/*======================================================*/\r\n\r\n //[Other desired views or initialization scripting HERE]\r\n\r\n/*======================================================*/\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you have successfully integrated ku4js-webApp into your application you will be able to call your controller\r\nmethods by calling \"controller.yourMethod\" where \"yourMethod\" is some method that you have created in your custom\r\ncontroller. For example, if you had implemented a controller with the method \"execute\" and wished to call it from\r\na button you would add the following HTML into the desired location of your web application:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button onclick=\"controller.execute(); return false;\">Execute</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Templates\r\nHas access to the following protected methods and properties:\r\n\r\n| API | Return | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| .$config(name:_String_) | config | Retrieves the template config named \"name\". |\r\n| .$forms(name:_String_) | config | Retrieves the forms templates config named \"name\" (Shortcut for $config(\"forms\")[name]). |\r\n| .$views(name:_String_) | config | Retrieves the views templates config named \"name\" (Shortcut for $config(\"views\")[name]). |\r\n| .$render(template:_String_, data:_{}_) | String | Renders the template using object literal or dto data. |\r\n| .$renderList(template:_String_, array:_Array<dto>_) | String | Renders template using object literal or dto data for each dto in array. |\r\n| .$renderListWithAction(array:_Array<dto>_, func:_Function_) | String | Calls a specified render function for each dto in array. It is important that the specified action return a string value! |\r\n\r\n* Runtime instantiation requires valid templates config. _(This is a potential scenario in advanced development of an\r\nenterprise applications and should be heeded. For example, if you create a template for generic form fields\r\nspecifically, i.e. $.ku4webApp.template(\"forms\", { /*Your methods here*/ }, and want to access it from another template,\r\n you will have to instantiate it on the fly and pass the local config to it: $.ku4webApp.template.forms(this.$config()))_.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4webApp.template(\"NAME\", {\r\n    //METHODS GO HERE\r\n    METHOD: function() { }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Configurations\r\n\r\nThe dependency injection of ku4js-webApp is largely dependent upon the configuration files. These files are required\r\nfor a ku4js-webApp project to work successfully. They are very simple files to configure. The ones listed here\r\nare required and must be included in your ku4js-web app. You can add more of them as you need making ku4js-webApp\r\n**_very_** extensible! Documentation for each of the required configuration follows:\r\n\r\n###config.collections\r\n\r\nConfigures the local client-side persistence callback structure.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    //COLLECTION\r\n    NAME: {\r\n        name: \"COLLECTION NAME\",\r\n        insert: \"ON CREATED\",\r\n        find: \"ON FOUND\",\r\n        update: \"ON UPDATED\",\r\n        remove: \"ON REMOVED\"\r\n    }\r\n */\r\n\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.collections = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR COLLECTIONS HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n###config.services\r\n\r\nConfigures the ajax services\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    NAME: {\r\n        verb: \"VERB\",\r\n        uri: \"URI\",\r\n        contentType: \"Content-Type\" //(OPTIONAL)\r\n        success: \"ON SUCCESS\",\r\n        error: \"ON ERROR\"\r\n    }\r\n */\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.services = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR SERVICES HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Service processId\r\n\r\nSometimes a developer retains state across service calls and in their architecture must be infomed which service call is\r\nresponsible for making the callback. ku4webApp service calls contain a processId for developers to use in this case.\r\nThis processId is returned when invoking the call method. This processId can be used to inform the system as to which\r\nservice call is making a notification of its callback. When a service makes a notification of its callback it will\r\nnotify each subscriber by passing any server data that was returned as a first argument and its processId as the second\r\narguments. Note the example callback method below:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction callback(serverData, processId) {\r\n    console.log(serverData); //This will log returned data\r\n    console.log(processId); //This will log the notifying servers processId\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n###config.sockets\r\n\r\nConfigures the ajax services\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    NAME: {\r\n        event: \"NAME\"\r\n        success: \"ON SUCCESS\",\r\n        error: \"ON ERROR\"\r\n    }\r\n */\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.sockets = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR SERVICES HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n###config.forms\r\n\r\nConfigures the forms that your controllers will read from when calling model methods that require user input, and that\r\nyour views will write to when there is data coming from the server that should be placed into the form on load, e.g.\r\nwhen a user is editing information that they have already provided.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    NAME: [\r\n        //FIRST FIELD\r\n        {\r\n            selector: \"DOM SELECTOR\",\r\n            type: \"TYPE\", (OPTIONS: field, select, checkbox)\r\n            required: BOOL\r\n        },\r\n        //SECOND FIELD\r\n        {\r\n            selector: \"DOM SELECTOR\",\r\n            type: \"TYPE\", (OPTIONS: field, select, checkbox)\r\n            required: BOOL\r\n        }]\r\n */\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.forms = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR FORMS HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n###config.validators\r\n\r\nConfigures the validation rules that your models can use to validate operation classes before they are transmitted\r\nto the server.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    //VALIDATOR\r\n    NAME: [\r\n        //VALIDATION RULE 1\r\n        {\r\n            name: \"DTO KEY TO VALIDATE\",\r\n            spec: SPEC ($.spec),\r\n            message: \"MESSAGE IF INVALID\"\r\n        },\r\n        //VALIDATION RULE 2\r\n        {\r\n            name: \"DTO KEY TO VALIDATE\",\r\n            spec: SPEC ($.spec),\r\n            message: \"MESSAGE IF INVALID\"\r\n        }]\r\n */\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.validators = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR VALIDATORS HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n###config.templates\r\n\r\nConfigures the templates in your web application. config.templates.forms and config.templates.views are required\r\ntemplate configurations.\r\n\r\n####config.templates.forms\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    NAME: 'HTML FORM FORMAT'\r\n */\r\n\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.templates.forms = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR FORM TEMPLATES HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n####config.templates.views\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/*\r\n    NAME: 'HTML FORMAT'\r\n */\r\n\r\n$.ku4webApp.config.templates.views = {\r\n    //ADD YOUR VIEW TEMPLATES HERE\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis project requires the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n* [ku4js-kernel](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-kernel)\r\n* [ku4js-data](https://github.com/kodmunki/ku4js-data)\r\n\r\n#Gotchas!\r\n\r\nSo, as with much JavaScript development, there may be a couple of gotchas! Below are listed a few of the items that\r\nnoobs (meant respectfully) may encounter. Let's just clear those up here, and if you have further questions, please,\r\nsend them to [support@kodmunki.com](mailto:support@kodmunki.com).\r\n\r\n1. Again, the configurations are **_key_** in this solution. They make things **_incredibly_** extensible but can\r\nbe a source of confusion for those new to IoC. The idea here is that you delegate your logic to the objects that \"care\"\r\nand **_only_** when they **_do_** \"care\". For example, your $collection may care about what it is and what it is\r\nsupposed to do, but it only \"cares\" when it actually has to perform it's operation. That said, you will **_certainly_**\r\nfind exceptions when you make calls to a collection via \"this.$collection(\"[NAME]\") if you have not **_configured_** a\r\ncollection in the required config \"config.collections.js\". If you find yourself with a \"Cannot read property 'name' of\r\nundefined\" error, for example. This likely means that you have not set up a config. In this example case, specifically,\r\nthis would indicate that you has not \"config-ed\" a collection that you are calling in your model. Config your collection\r\nin the appropriate \"config.collections.js\" my simply creating a \"key, object\" pair, i.e. \"[NAME]:{ name: \"[COLLECTION]\"}\r\nand you should resolve your exception. Generally, this holds true for services, forms, validators, and templates, as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n2. Note that when you create a controller, model, or view, you do so with the english singular, e.g.\r\n$.ku4webApp.**_view_**(\"[NAME]\", { /*Your methods here*/}, {/*Your listeners here*/}). When you call it after it is\r\ninstantiated, you will call it using the english plural, as it has become part of a collection of **_views_**.\r\nTherefore, you would call this view in your [application].js as $.ku4webApp.**_views_**.NAME. If misspelled you are\r\ncertain to run into to rather convoluted: \"Uncaught TypeError: Object function (s,t,u){function l(w,v){l.base.call(this,\r\nw,v)}l.prototype=t;$.Class.extend(l,b);$.ku4webApp.views[s]=function(v){var w=new l(v.templateFactory,v.formFactory);if(\r\n$.exists(u)){$.hash(u).each(function(x){v.mediator.subscribe(x.key,w[x.value],w)})}return w}} has no method 'NAME'\"\r\nerror. This is telling you that you have a missed \"Plural\" in your [application].js (A less obfuscated exception message\r\nis in progress).\r\n\r\n3. You are, certainly able to access external controllers, models, views, and templates from within the current method\r\nin scope, but you must ensure that you have instantiated it correctly. That is, you must pass **_all_** relevant\r\nparameters to the instance. This is only likely in an advanced development scenario with regard to templates. If you have\r\nquestions, please, review the documentation above, or contact [support@kodmunki.com](mailto:support@kodmunki.com).\r\n\r\n4. If you find **_any_** instance of an error that states, \"ku4EXCEPTION @ $.MEDIATOR:\" Check the call stack. You are\r\nlikely to have not subscribed to a notification. The mediator attempted to call it and could not find a subscriber.\r\nThis means that the named notifier is erroneous and should, likely, be removed.\r\n\r\n5. Along with #4 above, you could also have an exception in your callback method. Read the stack trace and your method\r\nimplementation carefully, you will likely find your issue in the implementation. For further questions, contact\r\n[support@kodmunki.com](mailto:support@kodmunki.com).\r\n\r\n#Other cool features\r\n\r\n1. Did you know that along with the simple CRUD ops of find, insert, update and remove, you can also include $in,\r\nand $orderby in your find criteria? The $in query takes an object whose key is the property that you are interested in\r\nand an array value whose content are the values that you would like to include in the search. $orderby, on the other\r\nhand, takes an object whose key is the property that you are interested in and a numeric value or 1 or -1. 1 for\r\nascending ordering and -1 for descending. For example: if you had a collection of persons and wanted to find all of the\r\npeople whose first name was John, Linda or Larry and order them by their age in ascending order you could query from\r\nyour model as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    return this.$collection(\"persons\")\r\n        .find({$in: {name: [\"John\", \"Linda\", \"Larry\"]}, $orderby: { age: 1 }});\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Did you know that ku4js-webApps ships with a testingBundle for you to use for your unit tests? You can see it\r\nat work in the example project's unit tests.
